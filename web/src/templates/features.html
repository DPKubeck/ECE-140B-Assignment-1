      <ol>
        <li> BotBuddy interacts and responds to you. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> BotBuddy's primary feature is its ability to interact and respond to you throughout your day. This allows BotBuddy to act as a friend throughout your day, and be both a fun toy and companion. The people who will benefit most from this interaction are customers who work from home and feel isolated, with them missing out on the social environment of the workplace. Anyone can enjoy and play with BotBuddy, but those customers will particulary benefit from the human like interaction they can get with BotBuddy. </li>
          </ul>
        
        <li> BotBuddy is a small device. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> Many other desk toys, AI robots, and desk robots are large in nature. This makes them take up a lot of room on your desk. Some of them also move around, requiring your desk to have substantial free space where they can roam, otherwise they won't work, or worst case, may bump into something that causes them to fall of your desk and break. BotBuddy is a simple, small device that can be placed anywhere: on your desk, on your speakers, on a nearby shelf. It will be about the size of a small coffee mug, making its physical precense almost unnoticable. This feature benefits all of our customers, because it doesn't require them to obtain a larger desk or to always keep their desk clean so BotBuddy can work. In particular, this is most beneficial for customers who are minimalists, or simply don't want clutter on their desk. BotBuddy is able to be low profile and stay out of the way, while at the same time having an appearance you like, making it an easy choice for something that will remain on your desk or in your room or office. </li>
          </ul>
          
        <li> BotBuddy has easily changeable and customizable external appearances. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> BotBuddy has an external shell that can look however you want. Ideally, we would sell different outside casing to our customers, so they can easily purchase a different appearance for their BotBuddy. On top of that, if customers are inclined to do so, they can 3D print their own external housing for BotBuddy, allowing their dreams to become reality (and allowing them to bypass any design copyright restrictions, such as Mario, Marvel, etc.). This feature is beneficial to all of our customers, because it allows them to customize BotBuddy to match their desk, their office, or their room, or take it in the opposite direction and make BotBuddy truly stand out. However, we think that professional customers as well as design-oriented customers will appreciate this feature most. This is because, for professional customers, they can keep BotBuddy looking mature and discrete, rather than having an appearance on it that makes it look like a child's toy. For design-oriented customers, they can match BotBuddy to whatever they please, or they can do custom artwork on a blank shell to show off their work in the form of an art and technology hybrid. </li>
            <li> This feature really stands out when compared to competing or related products. Nearly every other product in the same realm as BotBuddy cannot be customized in any way externally. This leaves customers trapped with the default look; if they like it, that is great. However if they don't, they may not use it as much, or they may even not purchase it to begin with. </li>
          </ul>
        
        <li> BotBuddy's personality can be customized. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> Every human is different, with a different personality, different tendencies, and different prefrences. BotBuddy is able to adjust to this by allowing small tweaks to be made to how it responds to and interacts with you. This means if you want BotBuddy to be more sassy, you can make that happen. If you want BotBuddy to be more reserved, or more outgoing, you can make that happen. This is a great feature for all of our customers, but in particular, particular customers will benefit the most from this. If you are the type of person to have everything just the way you like it, then you'll appreciate that you can tune BotBuddy to work best with your personality and wants. This feature is also in contrast with most other products; most other competing products you can't change anything about how they act, and the couple that do have settings only allow you to change the simplest of parameters. </li>
          </ul>
        
        <li> BotBuddy has an accompanying app. </li>
          <ul>
            <li> With BotBuddy comes an app. This app will primarily be used to do the first time setup of BotBuddy, as well as change BotBuddy's settings down the road. This is a significant ease of use feature for all of our customers. Instead of having buttons on the device, where you have to pull out the manual to know what they do and figure out yourself how it all works, BotBuddy is going to have a simple app that allows you to change its settings. On top of this, since the app will be paired with BotBuddy, if we want to release updates to the device itself, we can easily do that without the customer needing to plug it into their computer and download something from our website. We can also update the app itself with more features down the line. For example, one thing we'd like to add to the app after the MVP development is a to do list/reminder solution. This we could integrate with BotBuddy, so then if you put down a reminder at 5PM, BotBuddy will be able to tell you that to your face rather than you having to see and read (and not just swipe away) the reminder on your phone. </li>
          </ul>
